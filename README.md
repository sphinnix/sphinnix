- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sphinnix and I work as a Technological product owner in Konica Minolta Global R&D department. We develop innovative products based on Computer vision technologies.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about web development, that's why I have a Github account. It is for fun, but sometimes I acquire important pieces of information also for my work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and Python. I have also a home server with docker installed on it, so I can mess around with selfhosted stuff. 
- ðŸ“« If you wish to discuss about AI, Computer Vision, Blockchain, exciting products and projects drop me a message to alfonsofraire@gmail.com
